# Object Writing
Songwriters, poets, storytellers all benefit from being able to incorporate
as many of the natural senses into their work as possible.

One exercise that helps with this is object writing, wherein an object is selected,
then for a strict time limit, the writer uses every sense in a freeform writing
exercise about the object.
